# Music Festival Website

Welcome to the Music Festival Website project! This project is a showcase of my skills as a full-stack developer, utilizing the power of Gulp, Sass, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create an immersive and dynamic website for a music festival.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Gulp Automation:** Gulp is used for task automation, making the development process efficient and streamlined. Tasks such as minification, compilation, and live reloading are automated for a smooth workflow.

- **Sass for Styling:** Harness the power of Sass to write maintainable and modular stylesheets. The use of variables, mixins, and nested rules ensures a clean and organized styling approach.

- **JavaScript:** Utilize JavaScript to implement interactive features on the website. From smooth scrolling to dynamic content loading, JavaScript enhances the overall user experience.
